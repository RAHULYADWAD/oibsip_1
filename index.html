            <h1>NO AMOUNT OF MONEY<br> <span>EVER BOUGHT A SECOND OF TIME</span></h1>
            <p>Often considered the father of modern computer science, Alan Turing was famous for his work developing the first modern computers <br>After the war, Turing continued to develop his ideas about computer science. His work led to the construction of the first true computers, but his most famous work came in 1950 when he published a paper asking “can machines think?”. <br>He detailed a procedure, later known as the Turing test, to determine whether a machine could imitate human conversation. It became a foundational part of the field of artificial intelligence, though many modern researchers question its usefulness.
